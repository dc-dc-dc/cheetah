# Cheetah 

![tests workflow](https://github.com/dc-dc-dc/cheetah/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A simple and potentially fast backtesting setup for golang.

The goal is not to make something serious, but to mess around with some ideas in an area I know little about.

Don't use this for anything serious, unless you take full ownership of the results(unless of course they were good :D).

## Examples

### Exchange Example

```console
go run cmd/exchange_example/main.go
```

### Market Example

```console
go run cmd/market_example/main.go
```
